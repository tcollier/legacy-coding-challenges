== Problem description

Implement a caching system that has a limited number of slots for the cache. When all of the slots are filled and a new cache is written, the cache that was accessed longest ago will be deleted to make room for the new cache.

Do this in ruby or Node.js, if in ruby, package it into a gem.

Hints

  * A doubly linked list is a great data structure here
