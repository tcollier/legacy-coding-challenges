# Coding Challenges

This repo contains an array of coding challenges that can be used to quickly gauge a developers coding ability. Challenges can test general programming strength, e.g. write a string parser in your language of choice, or can drill down into the candidates knowledge of specific aspects of a given language or technology, e.g. write a Ruby program to highlight the difference between Proc and lambda.

Each challenge should be written up in a complete yet concise fashion in a README file in it's own directory. Any supporting code or documentation should also be contained in that directory (see /elevator as an example of a challenge with existing code).
