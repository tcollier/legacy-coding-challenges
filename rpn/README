# Problem description

Implement a Reverse Polish Notation (RPN) calculator that handles integer operands and the operators: +, -, *, /. Once the basic operators are working correctly, implement an 'abs' operator.

Write the solution in ruby or Node.js. If writing in ruby, publish the code as a gem.

## Extra credit

  * Can you do this without a if/eleif or case statement to implement the operator logic?
